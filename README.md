# Cancer Prediction with Lifestyle Factors

This project aims to develop a predictive model for cancer level based on lifestyle factors. The project is divided into three phases:

## Phase 1: Data Preprocessing

### Tasks

* Handle missing values
* Identify and remove outliers for numerical data
* Perform data reduction if necessary
* Convert numerical data to categorical data if necessary
* Conduct a series of statistical comparisons based on the dataset

## Phase 2: Extracting Frequent Patterns

### Tasks

* Extract frequent patterns from the clean dataset obtained from Phase 1
* Utilize relevant frequent pattern mining libraries, such as mlxtend

## Phase 3: Classification and Clustering

### Tasks

* Perform clustering on the dataset using appropriate algorithms
* Implement classification based on the defined classification problem for each group
* Reserve a portion of the dataset for testing the implemented classification

## Requirements

* Python
* 
* TensorFlow
* scikit-learn

## Installation

```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn nltk mlxtend
```

To install Hugging Face or sentence-transformers, follow their respective installation instructions.

## Usage
```python
python main.py
```

This will execute the project's workflow, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
